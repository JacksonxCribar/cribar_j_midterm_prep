# cribar_j_midterm_prep

#This homework assignment is meant to test our skill with flexboxes. 

#This assignment did not go well for me, I'm not sure what went wrong, I quite literally spent all night 6 pm approximatly to 11:00 am trying to figure out how to fix the code, and make it look nice, but it didnt turn out very good as you can clearly see :(

#Going to be trying to understand what went wrong before it's too late for the FIP midterm.
